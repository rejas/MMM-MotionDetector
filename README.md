# MMM-MotionDetector

## Installation

Just clone the module into your MagicMirror modules folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/rejas/MMM-MotionDetector.git
```

## Requirements

Accessing your (web)cam requires to have the client run on localhost or a HTTPS host (due to new requirements in Chrome for getUserMedia). The default value in your MagicMirror config.js is already `localhost` so most users shouldn't be affected.

Just in case you still have problems (like [here](https://github.com/rejas/MMM-MotionDetector/issues/6)) check your config and see if you can solve it by outcommenting the ip-address under

```JavaScript
var config = {
    	address : '0.0.0.0',
	...
```

#### Configuring MotionDetector with another module that requires MagicMirror address to be 0.0.0.0

You can do this by doing a simple workaround. You need to config the MagicMirror address to localhost (default) and set up a reverse proxy for the other module.

As MagicMirror uses an express server, you can install http-proxy-middleware plugin for express. Then you need to create 2 files:

routes.json

```JavaScript
{
  "routes": [
    {
      "route": "/mirror", // any path you like
      "address": "http://localhost:8080" // adrress of MagicMirror
    }
  ]
}
```

proxyserver.js

```JavaScript
// Dependencies
const express = require('express');
const proxy = require('http-proxy-middleware');

// Config
const { routes } = require('./routes.json');

const app = express();

for (route of routes) {
    app.use(route.route,
        proxy({
            target: route.address,
            pathRewrite: (path, req) => {
                return path.split('/').slice(2).join('/'); // Could use replace, but take care of the leading '/'
            }
        })
    );
}

// Start server and listen on port 8081
app.listen(8081, () => {});
```

Now just start the proxyserver e.g. with PM2 like you may run your MagicMirror.

You can now call http://ipaddress:8081/mirror/modulename and it will be forwarded to http://localhost:8080/modulename.

As you are bypassing browser security with this workaround you may want to add some credentials and/or ip-ranges which can access your proxyserver.

## Tested devices

So far I only used a [PlayStation3 Eye Webcam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Eye) for motion-detection at my MagicMirror. If you have successfully used this module with any other webcam, I'd be happy to hear about it.

If you want to use the wired PI-camera follow these steps provided by [@rev138](https://github.com/rejas/MMM-MotionDetector/issues/8#issuecomment-483356950):

    - Open /etc/modules-load.d/modules.conf
    - Add bcm2835-v4l2 to the end of the file and save it.
    - Reboot.
    - Profit

Another tutorial on how to enable the PI-camera in the browser can be found [in this blog post](https://reprage.com/post/pi-camera-module-in-the-browser).

## Mac support

Thanks to [3vidar](https://github.com/3vidar) you can also use this module on a Mac. For now the code only resides in the branch called "mac" in this git repo.

I hope to find the time to generalize it and have it in the mainline too.

## Using the module

To use this module, add it to the modules array in the `config/config.js` file:

```javascript
modules: [
  {
    module: "MMM-MotionDetector",
    position: "top_left", // Optional. This can be any of the regions. Displays debug informations.
    config: {
      // The config property is optional.
      // See 'Configuration options' for more information.
    },
  },
];
```

## Configuration options

The following properties can be configured:

| Option                | Description                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `captureIntervalTime` | Time in ms between capturing images for detection<br><br>**Default value:** `1000`                                                                        |
| `scoreThreshold`      | Threshold minimum for an image to be considered significant<br><br>**Default value:** `20`                                                                |
| `timeout`             | Time in ms after which monitor is turned off when no motion is detected<br><br>Set to -1 to never turn off the monitor<br><br>**Default value:** `120000` |

#### Default value:

```javascript
config: {
    captureIntervalTime: 1000,
    scoreThreshold: 20,
    timeout: 120000
}
```
